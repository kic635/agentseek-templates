# DeepAgents — streaming template

Scaffolds a DeepAgents Event Streaming v3 showcase. It uses a coordinator and
one `researcher` sub-agent, then presents the official event-streaming
projections in a browser UI:

- sub-agent lifecycle and nested paths;
- coordinator and sub-agent messages;
- tool execution lifecycle, inputs, output deltas, final output, and errors;
- state snapshots and final output;
- a raw protocol/debug view with sequence, method, namespace, and payload.

The backend uses the documented `graph.astream_events(input, version="v3")`
API and converts typed projections into a small application event protocol.
The React UI only consumes that application protocol, so protocol details stay
out of components.

## Feature tour

The demo is an event-streaming observability surface rather than a single
answer box. Each request produces a timeline that makes the execution tree and
the final result visible:

| Projection | What it represents | What the UI shows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `messages` | Coordinator and sub-agent text | Source, text, and path |
| `subagents` | Delegated agent lifecycle | Name, path, phase, and status |
| `tool_calls` | Tool execution | Input, output deltas, result, and errors |
| `values` | State snapshots during the run | Expandable state/debug payload |
| `output` | Final run state/result | Expandable final output |
| raw protocol | Ordered transport events | Sequence, method, namespace, and data |

The coordinator is instructed to delegate to `researcher`, and the researcher
uses the local `inspect_streaming_topic` tool. This makes delegation and tool
events observable without requiring a search provider. The UI also keeps a
stable `thread_id`, updates projection counters as events arrive, and renders
provider or stream failures as structured error cards.

The backend consumes the official v3 projections concurrently through the
LangGraph development server. The raw stream
preserves the protocol envelope (`seq`, `method`, `params.namespace`, and
`params.data`) while the adapter converts typed projections into a small,
frontend-safe event protocol. This first version intentionally keeps the
runtime on `langgraph dev` so the v3 projection behavior can be exercised
without depending on AgentSeek API projection support. AgentSeek API migration
can be added after the projection contract is stable.

## Quickstart

```bash
cp .env.example .env
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
$EDITOR .env

uv sync
npm install --prefix frontend
uv run langgraph dev --port 2024 --no-browser
# In another terminal:
npm run dev --prefix frontend
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:{{ cookiecutter.frontend_port }}` and try:

```text
Explain how Event Streaming v3 separates coordinator messages, sub-agent work, and tool calls.
```

The demo prompt asks the coordinator to delegate to `researcher`, which makes
the lifecycle visible without relying on an accidental model decision.

## Environment

`AGENTSEEK_MODEL_PROVIDER` selects `openai`, `anthropic`, or `google_genai`.
`AGENTSEEK_MODEL` selects the model. Fill the matching provider credential in
`.env`; a blank provider base URL uses that provider's official endpoint.

The template defaults to `openai` and `gpt-4.1-mini`. OpenAI-compatible gateways
can be used with `OPENAI_API_BASE` and a model served by that gateway.

## What the UI demonstrates

The backend follows the official Deep Agents event-streaming projections:

```text
stream.subagents  -> delegation cards and lifecycle
stream.messages   -> coordinator/sub-agent message rows
stream.tool_calls -> tool input, deltas, completion, and errors
stream.values     -> state snapshot panel
stream.output     -> final run output
for event in stream -> raw protocol debug panel
```

`name` is a display label. `path` is used as the stable branch key. The UI does
not treat `completed` as success for tools until `error` is also checked.

## Version boundary

The generated project pins `deepagents==0.6.12`, the first DeepAgents release
used by the sibling MCP template for the v3-era runtime surface. Do not copy
the raw event adapter into unrelated components; if the protocol changes,
update the adapter and its tests first.

## Lifecycle

The generated project declares lifecycle version 2 in `.agentseek/lifecycle.toml`.
The backend is served by `langgraph dev`, and the frontend uses Vite.
